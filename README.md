This theme is designed to accompany the [monokai-lightmode](https://github.com/moritzmhmk/atom-monokai-lightmode) theme when used with [mojave-darkmode](https://atom.io/packages/mojave-dark-mode).

This is a fork of [babsveloso](https://github.com/babsveloso/atom-monokai-light)'s mod of the original Monokai port by [kevinsawicki](https://github.com/kevinsawicki/monokai).
